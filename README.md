# Auction System

_This is the final project for "Basic Programming with Javascript" Course aimed to give new joiners a chance to put everything they learned so far into use_

Details can be seen in `task.pdf`

Changes should be made to `src/main.js`

### Getting Started

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the program

```bash
npm run start
```

### How to check your program?

#### Task 1: Auction Setup

-   The program validates user input for the number of items, ensuring it's a whole number and at least 10.
-   The program collects and accurately stores information for each item as prompted.
-   The inital bid is set to 0, and the buyer number is set to ''.

#### Task 2: Buyer Bids

-   The program correctly displays all item information.
-   When a user wants to place a bid, the program requests their buyer number and bid amount.
-   If a user's bid is lower or equal to the current highest bid, the program rejects it and prompts for a higher bid.
-   Valid bids replace previous ones along with the buyer number.
-   Users can place multiple bids on the same item.

#### Task 3: End of Auction

-   The program identifies items that have met their reserve prices and calculates a 10% fee on the final bid.
-   The program recognizes items that did not meet the reserve price but received bids.
-   The program identifies items that received no bids.
-   For sold items, the program accurately displays their item numbers and the final prices (including the 10% tax).
-   For unsold items, the program correctly displays their item numbers and the final bid amounts.
-   For items with no bids, the program accurately displays their item numbers.
-   The program provides correct counts for the number of items sold, unsold, and with no bids, which should match the total number of items.
